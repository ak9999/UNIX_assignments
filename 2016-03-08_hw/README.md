# Assignment:
1. Write a program that finds all users on a system. You should test for a large
number of UID numbers, since no function returns that information wholesale.
2. Modify the program that returns supplementary GIDs for a user to also list
these groupsâ€™ names.

# Building:
Run `make`.

# Running:
Execute `get_users` and `get_groups`.
