# Assignments for UNIX systems programming

This repo holds all the assignments I work on for my UNIX systems programming class.

## Why is it here?

1. So I can pull and push code where ever I am, from whatever computer I'm using.
2. So others can use it to learn if they wish to.

## What should I read?

Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment 3rd Edition by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago.

## Building

You will need:
1. a C compiler (the Makefiles call `gcc` but you can change it).
2. a UNIX system or environment like Cygwin
3. The required header files for the Single UNIX Specification.
